# Carcassone
Private project.


My version of teh board game Carcassone being developed using Unity

Jan 2019. The project has now progressed to the following point (currently on the Infinite Board branch).

1. Tiles can be correctly placed against others with matching edges.
2. A Tile stack can be setup and dealt with prespecified numbers of each card
3. A random board can be built using the starting tile the centre of the board.

That was quite a lot of work but the basics are now there. 

Next steps.

1. Start to work on the scoring system
2. Introduce some player controls for placemnt of cards
3. Investigate multiplayer mode.


This Git Hub mainly contains the c#scripts. I'm not paying much attention to the Unity Project settings on here at the moment.
